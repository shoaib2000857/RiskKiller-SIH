# Styles Overview (frontend/styles/)

## Purpose
Define styling strategy for the dashboards and supporting UI.

## Current Strategy
- Tailwind CSS is the primary styling system.
- globals.css (frontend/app) houses base styles and custom classes.
- tailwind.config.js defines theme extensions and content scanning.

## Design Principles
- Utility-first styling for speed and consistency.
- Layered backgrounds and gradients to convey urgency and depth.
- Consistent typography and spacing tokens across pages.

## Extension Ideas
- Introduce a design token map for risk levels and alert states.
- Add a dedicated typography scale for analyst dashboards.
